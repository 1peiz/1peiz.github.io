## No one:Techlead:

Not gonna lie,[Techlead](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechLead/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) is like the jammie Foxx of the tech industry,he is also very honest and open.  
He speaks in depth about his experience at top tech companeis,gives viewers insights onto his personal life,and share  
his controversial views on social justice issues.Some would call his openness an asset,while others would say it's the cause for  
patric shyu's failing. No matter one's veiw,these characterstics makes him one of the most polarizing and trending figures in tech.  

不骗你，Techlead 就像科技行业的 Jammie Foxx，他非常诚实和开放。

他深入讲述了自己在顶级科技公司的经历，让观众了解他的个人生活，并与他人分享

他在社会公正问题上颇具争议的观点。有些人认为他的开放是一种财富，而另一些人则认为这是

帕特里克 · 什尤的失败。不管你怎么想，这些性格特征使他成为科技界最极端和最流行的人物之一。

## His dark humor

This is some of his savage and funny quotes.

* Give a child a Linux, and they will become a backend engineer.  Give a child a PC, and they will become a .NET/game engineer.  Give a child a Mac, and they will become a mobile/web engineer.  

* Look,I don't care if you think you are cool,I don't care if you think I think you are cool,if you want me to say you are cool.Fine,you are cool,I am cool,we are all cool,everybody is cool,I'm  
just cooler than you.  
* Pop quiz,What'better than friends?  
 money!.  
* My wife left me which is all great and everything(about his ex wife).
* I've just been fired. So, let's take a moment to talk about Squarespace...
* "I don’t normally read emails from HR" 2 seconds later: "I thought why don't i have a friendly chat with HR like I normally do"
* In order to become a millionaire, you need to become a millionairel.
* I'm stronger, faster, smarter, better than other people. Where was I? Oh yeah why I don't have friends.
* You just have to stay strong during times like this.
Sell and hold,sell and hold.
You wanna sell low buy high,belive and I will see you at the core of the earth deep into the red one day.  

So if you actually saw some of his vedios,You will find that his sense of humour is off the charts.Beside that,You can learn a lot of things from his vedios.
