## No one:Techlead:

Not gonna lie,[Techlead](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechLead/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) is like the jammie Foxx of the tech industry,he is also very honest and open.  
He speaks in depth about his experience at top tech companeis,gives viewers insights onto his personal life,and share  
his controversial views on social justice issues.Some would call his openness an asset,while others would say it's the cause for  
patric shyu's failing. No matter one's veiw,these characterstics makes him one of the most polarizing and trending figures in tech.  

## His dark humor

This is some of his savage and funny quotes.

* Give a child a Linux, and they will become a backend engineer.  Give a child a PC, and they will become a .NET/game engineer.  Give a child a Mac, and they will become a mobile/web engineer.  

* Look,I don't care if you think you are cool,I don't care if you think I think you are cool,if you want me to say you are cool.Fine,you are cool,I am cool,we are all cool,everybody is cool,I'm  
just cooler than you.  
* Pop quiz,What'better than friends?  
 money!.  
* My wife left me which is all great and everything(about his ex wife).
* I've just been fired. So, let's take a moment to talk about Squarespace...
* "I donâ€™t normally read emails from HR" 2 seconds later: "I thought why don't i have a friendly chat with HR like I normally do"
* In order to become a millionaire, you need to become a millionairel.
* I'm stronger, faster, smarter, better than other people. Where was I? Oh yeah why I don't have friends.
* You just have to stay strong during times like this.
Sell and hold,sell and hold.
You wanna sell low buy high,belive and I will see you at the core of the earth deep into the red one day.
